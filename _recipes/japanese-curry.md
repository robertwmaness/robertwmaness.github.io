Ingredients:
- 4 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 pound chicken breast, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
- 1/2 a large yellow onion, diced to preferred size
- salt
- black and white pepper
- 3-4 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch knob ginger, minced
- 1 full block of S&B Japanese Curry Mix
- 4 tablespoons flour
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2-3 medium gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
- 1-2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
- (optional) 2 tablespoons honey
- (optional) MSG to taste

Instructions: 
1. In a large pot, heat oil until shimmering and loose. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until lightly browned, stirring occasionally. The goal is not to fully cook the chicken here as it will fully cook later in the broth while it simmers.
2. Add the onions and season with salt and black pepper and cook until softened.
3. Add garlic and ginger and cook until aromatic, stirring often.
4. Add the curry powder (dice it up beforehand to help it integrate easier) and stir in until fully integrated and lightly toasted, maybe 30 seconds. 
5. Add flour and stir well until all flour is fully mixed in with curry powder. It should look super thick and paste-y at this point. 
6. Add all the chicken broth and stir well until most of the curry has detached from the chicken/onions. Immediately add the potatoes and carrots. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat enough to keep it at a low simmer. Cover and cook until the potatoes and carrots are tender enough to serve.
7. Once everything is done, optionally add honey and MSG to taste. Serve over white rice.
